# Gesture-controlled-virtual-mouse
This code implements a gesture control system that uses MediaPipe to detect hand landmarks and classify gestures for virtual mouse control. The system processes video frames to detect hand positions, classifies the hands as left or right, and assigns the dominant and non- dominant hand accordingly. The HandRecog class identifies specific gestures, like pinching, to trigger corresponding controls. The video feed continues until the user stops it, with gestures being visually displayed. It integrates real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition to enable touch-free computer control.
